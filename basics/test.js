// PRIMITIVE Data Types in JavaScript
// number - can support any number upto 2^ 53
// bigint - can support numbers bigger than number data type
// string - always prefer "" to wrap your string
// boolean - true/false
// null - a standalone value in JS which acts as a place holder for empty value
   // eg: say, a server was to send us the temperature of a place upon request.
   // But due to some technical issues it couldnt send any data.
   // In this case, we can't assume the value to be 0 because that is also a valid temperature.
   // Thus comes "null" to save the day and take the place of the empty/no value.

// undefined - the value of a variable that has been declared but no value for that variable has been set
// symbol - a lil unique but we'll come back to it while learning about React
// 


// ADVANCED Data Type
// object

// console.log(typeof undefined); // tyepof keyword lets us know the data type of the value passed after it. In this case it's undefined
// console.log(typeof null) // object data type
